                 Slipakoff Consulting successfully helps companies prepare their leadership team to combat union corporate campaigns. Unions use various strategies, such as political action, community/public, and regulatory strategies, to apply pressure where the business is vulnerable. We help clients develop a comprehensive plan to counter potential damage from unions for recognition by a company without an NLRB secret ballot election.
